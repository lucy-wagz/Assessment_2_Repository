# Assessment_2_Repository
This repository contains all of the completed exercises necessary for the final Python assignment.

I have uploaded my original full assignment document (Assessment_2_230002756_GH) to the repository, but was having issues with my overall Google Colab Account as it kept saving my files as much larger than they actually are (sometimes they would save as 99KB and sometimes as 55,999 KB)
Because of this, the original Notebook does NOT contain the results of the cells as it would not let me upload the notebook even after clearing my intermediary results and library installs.
I uploaded individual versions of the notebook for easier access, and have split them into two parts (Assessment_2_230002756_P1_P2 and Assessment_2_230002756_P3_P4), though the P3/P4 notebook still had issues with uploading the code and outcomes.

Please let me know if there are any issues.
